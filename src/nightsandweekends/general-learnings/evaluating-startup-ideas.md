# ðŸŽ¯ evaluating startup ideas

source: startup school lectures

## common ideation failures

* don't start without a problem
* don't go over tarpit ideas, they from possible but is

> **note**\
> tarpit ideas are ideas that seem easy to solve, but really are near impossible to solve, which is why they haven't been solved yet.

* don't wait for the perfect idea (perfect ideas don't exist)
* don't miss to research and evaluate your idea thoroughly

## how to evaluate your idea

> **note**\
> this section contains accordian/dropdown questions, the dropdown menus open to show how to answer these

<details>

<summary>q: are you the perfect team to make this? (founder-market fit)</summary>

a common way to answer this is to look at the previous experiences/skill sets of your founders\
\
if you are building software to improve the analysis of historic things, having someone who has a background in archaeology and development helps

</details>

<details>

<summary>q: how big is the market?</summary>

there are two types of markets:\
\
1\. one that is already huge\
2\. one that according to you is gonna be huge soon (is rapidly growing)

</details>

<details>

<summary>q: do you have competition?</summary>

1\. if yes, rest assured your idea is probably super great that is the reason\
\
2\. if yes but you have a lot of competition, you need to find a unique selling proposition for your startup\
\
3\. if yes but the competitor is not doing well in your area/region of interest, eg: food delivery in places where doordash doesn't do well or doesn't exist, other companies (eg: zomato) get that opportunity and also have someone to look upto and be cautious of that someone's mistakes\
\
4\. if no, is it because the solution has been possible recently? if it was possible in the past too, it is possibly a tarpit idea, so be careful

</details>

<details>

<summary>q: do you want this?</summary>

yes? then work on it hell yeah!\
\
no? then find someone who might want it\
\
don't find someone who wants it? probably won't find enough users

</details>

<details>

<summary>q: would you work on this for years?</summary>

this is one is pretty obvious lmao

</details>

<details>

<summary>q: is this scalable?</summary>

if you building software, then it is a simple yes, no questioning needed.

</details>

<details>

<summary>q: is this a good idea space?</summary>

idea space is simply the market/tools that are related to that idea\
\
simply put, do you think that in your market, there will be a boom of growth or som'n where you can grow?

</details>

## good things to notice in your ideas

* does it have a hard barrier of entry or is it a very boring market? if yes you will have less competition (good for you)
* if you have any existing competitors then it probably means your idea rules the market ðŸ‘‘
* is your idea organic? if yes it is probably one of the coolest ones out there
* if your idea is not perfect but it is in a very fertile market (in need of a lot of innovation) you will find a lot of issues to fix, and you could pivot your idea to fixing those issues
