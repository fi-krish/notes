# üí° the idea of ideas

#### ideas, not plans

* ideas ain't no plan
* they are a thought
* that will evolve like a pokemon
* evolve and grow better and stronger every iteration

#### the story of ideas

* ideas start out as thoughts
* no one has idea how they go out
* in the case of farza, first built a productivity app called farzalog
* then a school for kids
* finally end up building buildspace
* so you do not start with the thing, you make the thing with what you started

#### "great ideas are forged not found"

* pick an idea and iterate
* until u finally reach the ["tower of god"](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]
* progress is not linear, you grow as long as you move

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/the incorrect idea.png" alt="if you choose the wrong idea, you&#x27;ll end up fixing it once or twice, but quicker because you&#x27;ll know what you did wrong, while if you waited for the right idea the one with the wrong idea who was iterating just took away your market"><figcaption><p>the iterator always wins.</p></figcaption></figure>

#### tldr

* ideas are starting points, they may pivot as you do deep into them
* work on something you are passionate about to give your project a heart ü´∂üèª
* precisely explain your thing such that it can be understood super easily by anyone
