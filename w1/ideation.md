# ideation

## [w1 lecture](https://lu.ma/bopdcq8j)

- ideas are starting points, they may pivot as you do deep into them
- work on something you are passionate about to give your project a heart ü´∂üèª
- precisely explain your thing such that it can be understood super easily by anyone

this is the original slide i came up with after this lecture:

![work laterally across teams and projects with ease and efficiency](https://github.com/xkrishguptaa/s4-journal/assets/135469703/4bb54d76-d794-4ef5-bd9d-f428ef6399a0)


## [startup school's class on getting and evaluating startup ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th8JoIan4dg)

### common ideation failures

- don't start without a problem

- don't go over tarpit ideas, they from possible but is

> **note**
> tarpit ideas are ideas that seem easy to solve, but really are near impossible to solve, which is why they haven't been solved yet.

- don't wait for the perfect idea (perfect ideas don't exist)

- don't miss to research and evaluate your idea thoroughly

### how to evaluate your idea

> **note**
> this section contains accordian/dropdown questions, the dropdown menus open to show how I answered them for my idea

<details>

<summary>
<b>q: are you the perfect team to make this? (founder-market fit)</b>

- common way to answer this is to look at the previous experiences / skill sets of your founders
- if you are building software to improve analysis of historic things, having someone who has background in archaeology and development helps

</summary>

i'm solo for this season of buildspace, i'm  a full stack developer, and love productivity, have the most complicated setup for productivity and probably the most complicated requirements as well (being a school student, who does full stack developer, devrel, creates content and hosts spaces on twitter and also volunteers at a bunch of communities as social media team lead, program manager, community manager, repository maintainer and more)

</details>

<details>

<summary>
<b>q: how big is the market?</b>

there are two types of markets:
- one that is already huge
- one that according to you is gonna be huge soon (is rapidly growing)

</summary>

i mean the productivity market is pretty big, so i don't need to explain much here

</details>

<details>

<summary>
<b>q: do you have competition?</b>

- if yes, rest assured your idea is prolly super great that is the reason
- if yes but you have a lot of competition, you need to find a unique selling proposition for your startup
- if yes but the competitor is not doing well in your area/region of interest, eg: food delivery in placed where doordash doesn't do well or doesn't exist, other companies (eg: zomato) get that opportunity and also have someone to look upto and be cautious of that someone's mistakes
- if no, is it because the solution has been possible recently? if it was possible in the past too, it is possibly a tarpit idea, so be careful
</summary>

mine is yes, it has crazy competition but divided, because the only company that comes close to doing it all is clickup but it is too complicated, my app won't be that complicated

</details>

<details>

<summary>
<b>q: do you want this?</b>

- yes? then work on it hell yeah!
- no? then find someone who might want it
- don't find someone who wants it? prolly won't find enough users

</summary>

i want this hell yeah, when i posted on twitter many other people also showed interest so they prolly want this too üí™üèª

</details>

<details>

<summary>
<b>q: would you work on this for years?</b>
</summary>

yes ofc hell yeah, i need this tool to manage my life lmao

</details>

<details>

<summary>
<b>q: is this scalable?</b>

- if you building software, then it is a simple yes, no questioning needed.

</summary>

im making software so yea

</details>

<details>

<summary>
<b>q: is this a good idea space?</b>

- idea space is simply the market/tools that are related to that idea
- simply put, do you think that in your market, there will be a boom of growth or som'n where you can grow?

</summary>

hell yes, developers and devrels still don't get the productivity tool they deserve, so mine simply rules

</details>

### good things to notice in your ideas

- does it have hard barrier of entry or is it a very boring market? if yes you will have less competition (good for you)
- if you have any existing competitors then it prolly means your idea rules the market üëë
- is your idea organic? if yes it is probably one of the coolest ones out there
- if your idea is not perfect but it is in a market which is very fertile (in need of a lot of innovation) you will find a lot of issues to fix, and you could pivot your idea to fixing those issues

*i also learnt copywriting before making this final slide, im gonna add the copywriting journal/notes later though, here's the slide*
